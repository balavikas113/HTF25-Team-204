# AI Outfit Planner

A comprehensive outfit planning solution available as both a web application and a React Native mobile app. This project was developed for the Hacktober/HTF25 "AI Outfit Planner for All Styles" hackathon.

## üåü Features

- **Smart Outfit Suggestions**: Get personalized outfit combinations based on your preferences
- **Style Preferences**: Choose from multiple style categories (Gen Z, Gen X, Classic)
- **Event-based Recommendations**: Get outfits for various occasions (Casual, Business, Formal, Party)
- **Weather Consideration**: Outfit suggestions adapted to different weather conditions
- **Color Preferences**: Select your preferred color scheme
- **Accessory Focus**: Customize your look with various accessories
- **Wardrobe Management**: Easily manage your clothing items
- **Favorites System**: Save and organize your favorite outfit combinations
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore your wardrobe and favorites

## üåê Web Application

Visit the live web application: [AI Outfit Planner Web](https://balavikas113.github.io/HTF25-Team-204/)

### Web Features
- Responsive design works on all devices
- No installation required
- Local storage for data persistence
- Modern, intuitive interface

What I added for you now
- `src/services/outfitService.js`: a heuristic-based outfit suggestion engine used by the app (runs in the React Native app).
- `tools/testOutfitEngine.js`: a standalone Node script that duplicates the engine logic so you can test suggestions quickly.
- `package.json` script: `npm run test-engine` to run the Node harness.

Quick start (run the engine without building the app)

1. Open PowerShell and go to the project folder:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\balavikas\OneDrive\Desktop\hacktober\AIOutfitPlanner'
```

2. Install dependencies (only needed for the RN app; the Node harness doesn't require them):

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run the test harness which prints a few example suggestions:

```powershell
npm run test-engine
```

This runs `node ./tools/testOutfitEngine.js` and prints sample outfit suggestions for a few styles/events.

How to run the mobile app (short)
- This is a React Native project (not Expo). To run the app on a device or emulator you'll need Node, the React Native CLI, and Android SDK or Xcode (for iOS). The usual commands are:

```powershell
# start Metro
npx react-native start
# in another terminal, run on Android (needs emulator or connected device)
npx react-native run-android
```

If you'd like an easier setup I can migrate this project to Expo so you can preview it using the Expo Go app without installing native SDKs.

Next improvements I can implement for you
- Add a wardrobe input UI so the app persists a user's clothing items and biases suggestions.
- Add a "Get alternative" button in `OutfitScreen` to rotate alternatives returned by the engine.
- Add a README section that walks through the code file-by-file for total beginners.
- Integrate an LLM-backed endpoint (OpenAI) for richer suggestions (requires adding a server or serverless function to keep API keys secret).

Code walkthrough (quick)
- `App.js` ‚Äî React Navigation setup (Stack navigator). Screens registered: `Home`, `Outfit`, `Favorites`, `Wardrobe`.
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.js` ‚Äî Home UI lets users pick style, event, weather and navigate to Outfit. Added a "Manage Wardrobe" button.
- `src/screens/OutfitScreen.js` ‚Äî Calls `getOutfitSuggestions(style, event, weather, wardrobe)` and shows the suggestion. Added the ability to cycle alternatives and view tips. Save to favorites saves the currently displayed suggestion.
- `src/screens/FavoritesScreen.js` ‚Äî Reads saved favorites from AsyncStorage via `src/services/favoritesService.js` and lists them.
- `src/screens/WardrobeScreen.js` ‚Äî Add/view/delete wardrobe items. Uses `src/services/wardrobeService.js` to persist items in AsyncStorage.
- `src/services/outfitService.js` ‚Äî Heuristic outfit suggestion engine (style pools, weather/event adjustments, wardrobe bias). This is where you'd later swap in an LLM call.
- `src/services/favoritesService.js` ‚Äî Simple favorites persistence.
- `src/services/wardrobeService.js` ‚Äî Wardrobe persistence (add/get/remove/clear).
